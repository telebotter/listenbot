## Listerer

I'm a telegram bot designed to provide simple check lists for any purpose. To handle more than one list per user and make them easy to share and organize I prever to use a new private group for each list. Once the group is created any message will be converted to a button in seconds and will be removed on click. To share lists with friends and collegues just invite them to the group.



### Add me

You should add me to your contact list before creating your first todo list.


### Create new Lists

- Create new group (supergroups not supported yet)
- Rename it to something meaningfull
- Invite me
- Give me admin permissions (all users are admins will not work)

### Permissions and Privacy

I'm using a database to store messages user id's and user names such as the title/name of each group without additional encryption. I need to be admin in the group to keep the chat history clean by removing processed messages from all users and bots. My goal is to keep one message containing the check list up to date and remove everything else. Don't invite me to groups you use for conversation, since I'll start to remove messages if you give me permissions (for each group).
